    "# Project Final Report\n",
    "\n",
    "### Due: Midnight on April 27 (2-hour grace period) — 50 points  \n",

    "### No late submissions will be accepted.\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Your final submission consists of **three components**:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Final Report Notebook [40 pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete all sections of this notebook to document your final decisions, results, and broader context.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Part A**: Select the single best model from your Milestone 2 experiments. Now that you’ve finalized your model, revisit your decisions from Milestones 1 and 2. Are there any steps you would change—such as cleaning, feature engineering, or model evaluation—given what you now know?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Part B**: Write a technical report following standard conventions, for example:\n",
    "  - [CMU guide to structure](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~brian/701/notes/paper-structure.pdf)\n",
    "  - [Data science report example](https://www.projectpro.io/article/data-science-project-report/620)\n",
    "  - The Checklist given in this week's Blackboard Lesson (essentially the same as in HOML).\n",
    "    \n",
    "  Your audience here is technically literate but unfamiliar with your work—like your manager or other data scientists. Be clear, precise, and include both code (for illustration), charts/plots/illustrations, and explanation of what you discovered and your reasoning process. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea here is that Part A would be a repository of the most important code, for further work to come, and Part B is\n",
    "the technical report which summarizes your project for the data science group at your company. Do NOT assume that readers of Part B are intimately familiar with Part A; provide code for illustration as needed, but not to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit this notebook as a group via your team leader’s Gradescope account.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. PowerPoint Presentation [10 pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a 10–15 minute presentation designed for a general audience (e.g., sales or marketing team).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prepare 8–12 slides, following the general outline of the sections of Part B. \n",
    "- Focus on storytelling, visuals (plots and illustrations), and clear, simplified language. No code!\n",
    "- Use any presentation tool you like, but upload a PDF version.\n",
    "- List all team members on the first slide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit as a group via your team leader’s Gradescope account.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Individual Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "Each team member must complete the Individual Assessment Form (same as in Milestone 1), sign it, and upload it via their own Gradescope account.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this part, you will finalize your best-performing model and revisit earlier decisions to determine if any should be revised in light of your complete modeling workflow. You’ll also consolidate and present the key code used to run your model on the preprocessed dataset, with thoughtful documentation of your reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reconsider **at least one decision from Milestone 1** (e.g., preprocessing, feature engineering, or encoding). Explain whether you would keep or revise that decision now that you know which model performs best. Justify your reasoning.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Reconsider **at least one decision from Milestone 2** (e.g., model evaluation, cross-validation strategy, or feature selection). Again, explain whether you would keep or revise your original decision, and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Below, include all code necessary to **run your final model** on the processed dataset. This section should be a clean, readable summary of the most important steps from Milestones 1 and 2, adapted as needed to fit your final model choice and your reconsiderations as just described. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Markdown cells and inline comments to explain the structure of the code clearly but concisely. The goal is to make your reasoning and process easy to follow for instructors and reviewers.\n",
