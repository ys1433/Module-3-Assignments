    "In this homework, you will learn how to **create** and **explore** a simple, synthetic regression dataset using scikit‐learn’s `make_regression` function. We often use synthetic data to **test out** our modeling workflows, gain **hands‐on experience** with linear regression, and observe how **noise**, **training set size**, and other factors affect model performance. By controlling the dataset generation, you can see precisely how well the model recovers known parameters, and you’ll practice splitting data into training and testing sets to measure **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**. This will give you insight into how regression models behave under different conditions (such as varying amounts of training data) and help you interpret the resulting errors and comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some problems you will need to do a bit of research in `sklearn`'s documentation. The functions we are using are very common in ML, and it will be well worth the time you spend reading through the documentation and looking at the examples provided there. \n",

    "As I mentioned in the Live Session, some things I will ask you do to are not graded; I expect you to do them just as thoroughly as the answers which will be graded.  To skip the non-graded parts\n",

After each cell in which you assign a value to a variable such as a1a etc. there is a cell which will check your solution. Therefore, you may test your solutions as much as you wish before submitting to Gradescope. Starting with HW 03, you will receive your grades only after the late period is over."
