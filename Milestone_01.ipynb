    "| Method | Best For | Code Example | Pros | Cons |\n",
    "|--------|---------|--------------|------|------|\n",
    "| **Drop Missing Values** | Few missing values (<5% of data) | `df.dropna()` | Quick and easy | Can remove valuable data |\n",
    "| **Mean Imputation** | Normally distributed numerical data | `df.fillna(df.mean())` | Preserves mean; simple | Distorts variance, weak for skewed data |\n",
    "| **Median Imputation** | Skewed numerical data | `df.fillna(df.median())` | Robust to outliers | May not capture patterns |\n",
    "| **Mode Imputation** | Categorical features | `df.fillna(df.mode().iloc[0])` | Keeps most common category | Can introduce bias |\n",
    "| **Constant Value (e.g., 0)** | Special cases (e.g., unknown numerical data) | `df.fillna(0)` | Simple and interpretable | Can mislead model |\n",
    "| **\"Unknown\" Category Imputation** (**New Addition**) | Categorical features with missing values | `df.fillna('Unknown')` | Keeps all rows, prevents data loss | May introduce artificial category |\n",

    "| **Multivariate Imputation (MICE)** | Complex relationships between variables | `IterativeImputer().fit_transform(df)` | Captures relationships | Slower than mean/median |\n",

    "- Customer data (e.g., missing survey responses → \"No Response\").  \n",
    "- Product categories where missing could be a separate group.  \n",
